# PlutoSDR Projects

Create new issues with suggestions for other software to package into images for the PlutoSDR and I'll see what I can do.

# TO-DO
--sdrdaemon as a POC - had issues cross-compiling for neon even after tricking cmake into thinking I was neon - ON-HOLD for now.
--Something else like 'rtl_tcp' would be nice but rx_tools doesn't seem to have an 'rx_tcp'.  Will do some more searching, has to support SoapySDR or libiio directly.
